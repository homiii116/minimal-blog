## Hi, Hei, こんにちは！

I'm Miho, a front-end developer from Japan, living in Norway. I'm passionate about creating things with JavaScript & React.

I mainly develop websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript(&React). Creating both of static sites and dynamic sites by using SSG, CMS(WordPress), markup-based or etc. I also write tech articles about JavaScript on web media. 
>It's an honour to be associate with people and new technology !

I learned front-end on my own and from a mentor while I was working as a bookkeeper at a previous company. I also have joined some tech communities to improve my knowledge and skills. After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had a chance to get job offers from clients, and expanded the business as a new career.
