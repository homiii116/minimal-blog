## Hi, Hei, こんにちは！ 

![miho](./profile-pic.png)

I'm Miho, a student in IT living in Norway. I'm passionate about creating things with JavaScript & React.

I am mainly studying IT system and some programming languages at university and personaly focusing on front-end development. Since I have learned that front-end development has a lot og relations with user experience, I am also interested in UX. 

I have experienced some small projects both of personally and with clients, and created both of static sites and dynamic sites by using SSG, CMS(WordPress), markup-based or etc. 
I also wrote tech articles about JavaScript on web media. 

>It's an honour to be associate with people and new technology !

I learned front-end on my own and from a mentor while I was working as a bookkeeper at a previous company. I also have joined some tech communities to improve my knowledge and skills. After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had a chance to get job offers from clients, and expanded the business as a new career.

### This site
This site is built by GatsbyJS, a static site generator.
I used [minimal-blog-theme provided by LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) and shadowed files. ("Shadowing" is a concept of Gatsby when you want to customize and make any changes from original themes)

Gatsby made this site faster and safer !
