## HiÔºÅ 

I'm Miho, who is passionate about creating things with JavaScript & React.

### My Bio
I learned frontend programming languages on my own at the beginning. After resigning from my previous job as a bookkeeper, I had a chance to work on some projects with clients such as building websites and writing tech articles about JavaScript. That brought me to ekpand my knowledge. 

Now I'm studying programming, database, interaction design, and so on at university as a 3rd-year IT-student. Outside of university, I'm focusing on modern front-end development. Since I've learned frontend technology has a lot of relations with UX-design, I'm also interested in UX-design. 
In my private time, I enjoy going on a hike to beautiful mountains here in Bergen!

### This site
This site is built by GatsbyJS, a static site generator.
I used [minimal-blog-theme provided by LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) and shadowed files. ("Shadowing" is a concept of Gatsby when you want to customize and make any changes from original themes)

Gatsby made this site faster and safer !
